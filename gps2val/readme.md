# GPS Feeder
consumes [gpsd](https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/) as datasource and pushes location to kuksa.val server.
The [`gpsd_feeder.ini`](./config/gpsd_feeder.ini) contains `kuksa.val` and `gpsd` configuration.

Before starting the gps feeder, you need to start `kuksa.val server/databroker` (for this have a look at [KUKSA.val server](../../kuksa-val-server/README.md) and [KUKSA.val databroker](../../kuksa_databroker/README.md)). You have to start an instance of `gpsd` by running:
```
gpsd -S <gpsd port> -N <gps device>
```

If you do not have a gps device, you can use your cellphone to forward gps data to `gpsd`. For example [gpsd-forward](https://github.com/tiagoshibata/Android-GPSd-Forwarder) is an open source android app. You can start gpsd with the following command to receive data from the app:

```
gpsd -N udp://0.0.0.0:29998
```
## Install dependencies and execution
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python gpsd_feeder.py
```

### Using docker
You can also use `docker` to execute the feeder platform independently.
To build a docker image:
```
docker build -t gpsd_feeder .
```

You can also download docker images from [our container registry](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val.feeders/pkgs/container/kuksa.val.feeders%2Fgps).

To run:
```
docker run -it -p 29998:29998/udp -v $PWD/config:/config gpsd_feeder
```

The container contains an internal gpsd daemon and the exposed UDP port can be used to feed NMEA data e.g. with [gpsd-forward](https://github.com/tiagoshibata/Android-GPSd-Forwarder) from an Android phone. If you already have a configured GPSd, just modify the config file to point to it.

Keep in mind, that GPSd normally only listens on localhost/loopback interface. To connect it from another interface start gpsd with the `-D` option

## Test with gpsfake
You can also use [gpsfake](https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/gpsfake.html) to playback a gps logs in e.g. nmea format.
To install `gpsfake`, follow the command in this [link](https://command-not-found.com/gpsfake).
After installation, run the following command to simulate a gps device as datasource:

```
gpsfake -P 2947 simplelog_example.nmea
```

Note: You need to use the `gpsfake` with the same version like the installed `gpsd`.

There are several tools for generating nmea log files:
- [nmea-gps logger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nmea-gps-logger)
- [nmeagen](https://nmeagen.org/)
