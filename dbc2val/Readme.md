# Feeder CAN for real CAN interface or dumpfile replay

This is an a DBC CAN feeder for the VAL databroker. The basic operation is as follows:
The feeder connects to a socket CAN interface and reads raw CAN data, that will be parsed based on a DBC file. The mapping file describes which DBC signal
should be matched to which part in the VSS tree. The respective data point will then send out to the databroker.
It is also possible to replay CAN dumpfiles without the SocketCAN interface being available, e.g. in a CI test environment.
See "Steps for a local test with replaying a can dump file"

This is a module was taken from <https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val/tree/master/kuksa_feeders/dbc2val>
and afterwards adapted to the VAL databroker and extended to handle the replay of candump files without using the socket CAN interface.

## Prerequisites for using socket CAN or virtual socket CAN

1. install can utils

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install can-utils
   ```

1. check that at least python version 3 is installed

   ```bash
      python -V
   ```

1. Install the needed python packages

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

1. If the generated gRPC files are not available see: gRPC related...
   for a local test see: steps for a local test...

## Steps for a local test with socket can or virtual socket can

1. Use the argument --use-socketcan or you can remove the line with the dumpfile in `config/dbc_feeder.ini`

1. Start the can player

   ```bash
   ./createvcan.sh vcan0
   canplayer vcan0=vcan0 -v -I candump.log -l i -g 1
   ```

1. Start the vehicle databroker server

   ```bash
   cd vehicle_data_broker
   cargo run --bin vehicle-data-broker
   Output:
   Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.51s
   Running `target/debug/vehicle-data-broker`

## Provided can-dump files

[candump_Manual_SOC_DogMode_CabinTemp.log](./candump_Manual_SOC_DogMode_CabinTemp.log): Contains state-of-charge, dog mode, and cabin temperature signals. Take this if using the [dog mode example in the vehicle-app-python-sdk repo](https://github.com/SoftwareDefinedVehicle/vehicle-app-python-sdk/tree/main/examples).

[candump.log](./candump_Manual_SOC_DogMode_CabinTemp.log): Long running can-dump without state-of-charge, dog mode, and cabin temperature signals.

Configuration options have the following priority (highest at top).

## usage of the file mapping.yml

Please replace the values xxx with our content for a new signal <br>
template:
```bash
xxx: # CAN signal name taken from the used dbc file
  minupdatedelay: xxx # update interval of the signal in ms, if no delay given default is 1000ms
  vss: # vss definition
    datatype: xxx # type of the data
    type: xxx # type of the value
    unit: xxx # untie of the value
    description: # description of the value
  databroker:
    datatype: xxx # The value ist taken from ../swdc-os-vehicleapi/feeder_can/gen_proto/sdv/databroker/v1/types_pb2.py
    changetype: xxx # The value ist taken from ../swdc-os-vehicleapi/feeder_can/gen_proto/sdv/databroker/v1/types_pb2.py
 targets:
    xxx: {} # Name of the VSS signal
```
example:
```bash
UIspeed_signed257: # CAN signal name taken from the used dbc file
  minupdatedelay: 100 # 100ms update interval of the signal
  vss: # vss definition
    datatype: float # type of the data
    type: sensor # type of the value
    unit: km/h # untie of the value
    description: vehicle speed # description of the value
 databroker:

    changetype: 1 # CONTINUOUS The value ist taken from ../swdc-os-vehicleapi/feeder_can/gen_proto/sdv/databroker/v1/types_pb2.py
 targets:
    Vehicle.OBD.Speed: {} # Name of the VSS signal
```
## gRPC related for local testing (should be implemented via git actions)

1. Need to use the proto files
   ../vehicle_data_broker/proto/sdv/edge/databroker/broker/v1/broker.proto
   ../vehicle_data_broker/proto/sdv/edge/databroker/collector/v1/collector.proto

1. Generate python files from grpc.proto file:
   First, install the grpcio-tools package:

   ```bash
   pip install grpcio-tools
   ```

   Use the following command to generate the Python code:

   ```bash
   mkdir gen_proto
   python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I../vehicle_data_broker/proto --python_out=gen_proto --grpc_python_out=gen_proto \
     ../vehicle_data_broker/proto/sdv/databroker/v1/collector.proto \
     ../vehicle_data_broker/proto/sdv/databroker/v1/broker.proto \
     ../vehicle_data_broker/proto/sdv/databroker/v1/types.proto
   ```

1. The output files are:
   collector_pb2_grpc.py
   collector_pb2.py
   databroker_pb2_grpc.py
   databroker_pb2.py

## Logging

The log level of `dbcfeeder.py` can be set using the LOG_LEVEL environment variable

To set the log level to DEBUG

```shell
LOG_LEVEL=debug ./dbcfeeder.py
```

Set log level to INFO, but for dbcfeeder.broker set it to DEBUG

```shell
LOG_LEVEL=info,dbcfeeder.broker_client=debug ./dbcfeeder.py
```

or, since INFO is the default log level, this is equivalent to:

```shell
LOG_LEVEL=dbcfeeder.broker_client=debug ./dbcfeeder.py
```

Available loggers:
- dbcfeeder
- dbcfeeder.broker_client
- databroker
- dbcreader
- dbcmapper
- can
- j1939

## ELM/OBDLink support
The feeder works best with a real CAN interface. If you use an OBD Dongle the feeder can configure it to use it as a CAN Sniffer 
(using  `STM` or `STMA` mode). The elmbridge will talk to the OBD Adapter using its custom AT protocol, parse the received CAN frames, 
and put them into a virtual CAN device. The DBC feeder can not tell the differenc

There are some limitations in this mode
 * Does not support generic ELM327 adapters but needs to have the ST commands from the OBDLink Devices available: 
 This code has been tested with the STN2120 that is available on the KUKSA dongle, but should work on other STN chips too
 * Bandwidth/buffer overrun on Raspberry Pi internal UARTs:When connecting the STN to one of the Pis internal UARTs you will 
 loose messages on fully loaded CAN busses (500kbit does not work when it is very loaded). The problem is not the raw bandwith 
 (The Pi `/dev/ttyAMA0` UART can go up to 4 MBit when configured accordingly), but rather that the Pi UART IP block does not support 
 DMA and has only an 8 bytes buffer. If the system is loaded, and you get scheduled a little too late, the overrun already occuured. 
 While this makes this setup a little useless for a generic sniffer, in most use cases it is fine, as the code configures a dynamic 
 whitelist according to the confgured signals, i.e. the STN is instructed to only let CAN messages containing signals of interest pass.

When using the OBD chipset, take special attention to the `obdcanack` configuration option: On a CAN bus there needs to be _some_ device 
to acknowledge CAN frames. The STN2120 can do this. However, when tapping a vehicle bus, you probbably do not want it (as there are otehr 
ECUs on the bus doing it, and we want to be as passive as possible). On theother hand, on a desk setup where you have one CAN sender and 
the OBD chipst, you need to enable Acks, otherwise the CAN sender will go into error mode, if no acknowledgement is received. 

## SAE-J1939 support
When the target DBC file and ECU follow the SAE-J1939 standard, the CAN reader application of the feeder should read 
PGN(Parameter Group Number)-based Data rather than CAN frames directly. Otherwise it is possible to miss signals from 
large-sized messages that are delivered with more than one CAN frame because the size of each of these messages is bigger 
than a CAN frame's maximum payload of 8 bytes. To enable the J1939 mode, simply put `--j1939` in the command when running `dbcfeeder.py`.
Prior to using this feature, j1939 and the relevant wheel-packages should be installed first:

```bash
pip install j1939
git clone https://github.com/benkfra/j1939.git
cd j1939
pip install .
```

The detailed documentation to this feature can be found here https://dias-kuksa-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents/j1939.html
