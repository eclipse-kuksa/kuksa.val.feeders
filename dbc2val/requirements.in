# This file contains top level dependencies pinning a major version.
# For developing the dbc2val package it makes sense to use this file
# with 'pip install -r requirements.in' in order to benefit from more
# recent minor versions of the dependencies.
#
# For creating/distributing a binary, all dependencies should
# be pinned to specific versions in order to provide for a reproducible
# build.
#
# The 'pip-tools' package's 'pip-compile' command can be used for that
# purpose. The following command will take the inputs from this file
# and create a 'requirements.txt' file with pinned versions of all
# dependencies:
#
# pip-compile --upgrade requirements.in
#
# If you depend on pre-releases (of e.g. kuksa-client) use
#
# pip-compile --pre --upgrade requirements.in
