# This is a VSS example overlay that is to be used when generating vss_dbc.json in this repository
# The content shall just be seen as examples that can be used for prototyping.
# It does not in any way represent an official mapping.
#
# How to regenerate vss_dbc.json:
#
# 1. Decide which VSS version to use
#
# Two good places to check:
# * See what versions KUKSA.val supports: https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val/tree/master/data/vss-core
# * See what VSS releases that exists: https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification/releases
#
# (You can also also clone the VSS-repo and use whatever version you like)
#
# 2. Download Yaml file for selected verison.
#
# As of today part of a *.tar.gz file in https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification/releases
#
# 3. Regenerate the json file
#
# vss-tools/vspec2json.py -e dbc -o dbc_overlay.vspec --json-pretty --no-uuid vss_rel_3.1.1.yaml vss_dbc.json
#
# (For this you must typically have cloned https://github.com/COVESA/vss-tools)

#
#
# Type and datatype required, others will be inherited
